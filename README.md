# MuthuGanesh_TDD_OptimizedRoute

I've created a single java file which contains couple of classes in it
    Class - Gate, ConnectedTo(Stores the neighbors of Gate), Departures(flight details), Bags(Bag details) and OptimizedRoute(this
            calculates the optimized route to transfer the bag)
            
A JUnit Java test file to test all the methods - insertion onto each class, route calculation(both positive and negative test cases)

Finally a RunTests method which executes all the unit tests written in OptimizedRouteTest and prints if there is any failure.
